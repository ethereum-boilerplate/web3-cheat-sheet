## Audience
This is an ebook for web2 developers that want to learn web3 as soon as possible.

This book assumes that the web2 developer reading this book is already a bit interested in crypto and web3 but hasn't yet taken the step into web3.

This book needs to motivate the web2 developer to start their web3 journey by showing the opportunities and growth potential of web3. We need to explain that the developers of any kind now can program money if they learn the skills we are going to teach them.

This book assumes that the reader has basic web development knowledge and is familiar with frameworks like React.

This book shouldn't be more than 20 pages long - it should have nice graphics.
